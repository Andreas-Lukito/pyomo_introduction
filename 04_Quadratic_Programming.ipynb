    "A manufacturer has developed an empirical model of its production system and has determined that the daily production cost is given by:\n",

    "$\\text{cost} = 0.4x_1^2 - 5x_1 + x_2^2 - 6x_2 + 50$\n",

    "The manufacturer must produce at least 20,000 units per day.  \n",
    "Unit 1 is an older but durable machine that produces 2,700 units per hour and can operate for up to 18 hours per day.  \n",
    "Unit 2 is a newer and faster machine that produces 3,600 units per hour but can operate for at most 9 hours per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "* The objective function is quadratic because it has only linear and squared terms. The quadratic terms model increasing operating costs due to wear, energy consumption, and inefficiencies at higher utilization levels.\n",

    "IPOPT produces only slightly above the required production level, resulting in the **lowest total cost** and **lowest cost per unit**.\n",
    "#### HiGHS solver\n",

    "Interestingly, IPOPT and HiGHS return different optimal solutions. IPOPT produces close to the minimum required output, while HiGHS operates both machines near their upper limits. This difference arises because the production constraint is specified as a lower bound rather than an equality, **allowing overproduction without explicit penalty**. Since the objective **minimizes cost** only and <b style=\"color:red\">does not include revenue or demand-matching incentives</b>, multiple feasible solutions exist. This highlights the importance of **properly modeling demand constraints** in optimization problems."
