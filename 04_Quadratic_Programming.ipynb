    "The matrix formulation shown above is used internally by many solvers (and commonly shown in MATLAB-style interfaces).\n",
    "\n",
    "When modeling problems in **Pyomo**, constraints and objectives are written **directly as equations**, not in matrix form.  \n",

    "The matrix form is presented here **for explanation purposes only**, to help understand how QP solvers work under the hood.\n",

    "Quadratic Programming is **Linear Programming written in matrix form with a quadratic objective**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\min \\left( \\frac{1}{2} x^T H x + f^T x \\right)$\n",

    "## Production Cost Optimization Problem\n",
    "### Problem Description\n",
    "A manufacturer has developed an empirical model of its production system and has determined that the daily production cost is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{cost} = 0.4x_1^2 - 5x_1 + x_2^2 - 6x_2 + 50$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the decision variables representing the number of hours per day that Unit 1 and Unit 2 are operated, respectively. The objective is to determine the optimal operating hours for both units that minimize the total production cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "The manufacturer must produce at least 20,000 units per day.  \n",
    "Unit 1 is an older but durable machine that produces 2,700 units per hour and can operate for up to 18 hours per day.  \n",
    "Unit 2 is a newer and faster machine that produces 3,600 units per hour but can operate for at most 9 hours per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "* The objective function is quadratic because it has only linear and squared terms. The quadratic terms model increasing operating costs due to wear, energy consumption, and inefficiencies at higher utilization levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A quadratic function can also have bilinear ($x_1x_2$) terms which products of the two independent variables."
