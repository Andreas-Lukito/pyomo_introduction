    "## What is Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming?\n",
    "**Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP)** extends **Nonlinear Programming (NLP)** by allowing **integer or binary decision variables**, similar to how **Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)** extends **Linear Programming (LP)**.\n",

    "- **NLP** -> Nonlinear equations with continuous variables\n",
    "- **MINLP** -> Nonlinear equations **+** integer / binary logic\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows us to model problems that involve both:\n",
    "- **Nonlinear system behavior** (e.g., exponential costs, efficiency curves)\n",
    "- **Discrete decisions** (e.g., on/off, choose A or B)\n",

    "## Why MINLP is Needed\n",
    "Many real-world problems involve logical decisions that affect nonlinear behavior.  \n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- Turning a machine **on/off** changes nonlinear energy consumption\n",
    "- Choosing a technology activates a different nonlinear cost function\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect **logic decisions (yes/no, on/off)** with **nonlinear equations**, MINLP models often use techniques such as:\n",

    "- Indicator constraints\n",
    "- Disjunctive formulations\n"
