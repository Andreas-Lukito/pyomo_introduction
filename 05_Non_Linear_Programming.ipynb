    "## What is Non-Linear Programming?\n",
    "**Non-Linear Programming (NLP)** is an optimization problem in which:\n",
    "- the **objective function is non-linear**\n",
    "- **one or more constraints are non-linear**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-linear functions may include polynomial, exponential, logarithmic, or trigonometric terms, making the optimization problem more complex than linear or quadratic programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges in Non-Linear Programming\n",
    "NLP problems introduce several challenges, including:\n",
    "- The presence of **local optima and a global optimum**, where solvers may converge to a locally optimal solution instead of the best overall solution (if you are familiar with training machine learning or deep learning models, this behavior may feel familiar)\n",
    "- **Non-convexity**, unlike convex QP problems where a unique global optimum is guaranteed\n",
    "- **Increased computational complexity** due to non-linear objective functions or constraints\n",

    "## Production Cost Optimization Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets head back to the production cost problem from the [previous notebook](04_Quadratic_Programming.ipynb) and adjust it so it simulates NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Things that would be modified:**\n",
    "* **The Objective Fucntion:**\n",
    "    * Now lets say there would be an additional cost due to the machines overheat which makes electricity bill for cooling increases in a rate of $3e^{0.1x_1}$ and $5e^{0.15x_2}$.\n",
    "* **The Constraints:**\n",
    "    * Effective production is reduced at rates of $ (1 - \\frac{1}{1 + x_1}) $ and $ (1 - \\frac{1}{1 + x_2}) $, introducing non-linearity into the production constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Description\n",
    "A manufacturer has developed an empirical model of its production system and has determined that the daily production cost is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{cost} = 0.4x_1^2 - 5x_1 + x_2^2 - 6x_2 + 3e^{0.1x_1} + 5e^{0.15x_2} + 50$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the decision variables representing the number of hours per day that Unit 1 and Unit 2 are operated, respectively. The objective is to determine the optimal operating hours for both units that minimize the total production cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "The manufacturer must produce at least 20,000 units per day.  \n",
    "Unit 1 is an older but durable machine that produces 2,700 units per hour and can operate for up to 18 hours per day.  \n",
    "Unit 2 is a newer and faster machine that produces 3,600 units per hour but can operate for at most 9 hours per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming the machine runs nonstop we would add production effeciency loss of $ (1 - \\frac{1}{1 + x}) $ due to the machine overheating  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note:  \n",
    "Due to the non-linear cost function and the non-linear production efficiency, this problem is formulated as a **Non-Linear Programming (NLP)** problem."
